# Height_predection
Height Prediction Based on Weight Using Linear Regression

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a Linear Regression model to predict a person's height (in centimeters) based on their weight (in kilograms). The project involves preprocessing the data, training the regression model, and evaluating its performance.

Features
Input: Weight (in kilograms)
Output: Predicted Height (in centimeters)

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used to build the model.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
